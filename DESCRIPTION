Description: Estimates key quantities in causal mediation analysis - including 
    average causal mediation effects (indirect effects), average direct 
    effects, total effects, and proportions mediated - in the presence of 
    multiple uncausally related mediators. Methods are described by 
    Jerolon et al., (2021) <doi:10.1515/ijb-2019-0088> and extended to 
    accommodate survival outcomes as described by Domingo-Relloso et al., 
    (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.02.16.24302923>.
